# 167FinalRepo

This is Project 2 of CMPM 121 - Game Technologies

Here is the link to the video of the "game" (sequence): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HlJ9_aEUDd4bCteykBj2ES7M0o4hdxTV/view?usp=sharing
 
I forgot to mention that I also included a point light which you can also see as an occasional blue flashing light when the sequence starts.

Some resources I used while building the project:
